### System Design Guidelines

1. **Understanding Requirements:** Comprehend both functional and non-functional requirements before designing.
   
2. **Use Case Definition:** Clearly define the use cases and constraints of the system.

3. **Tradeoffs:** Acknowledge that no solution is perfect; designing involves making tradeoffs.

4. **Flexibility for Change:** Design the system to be flexible as requirements will change over time.

5. **Fault Tolerance:** Assume failures are inevitable and design the system to be fault-tolerant.

6. **Avoid Over-Engineering:** Add functionality only when necessary to prevent over-complication.

7. **Scalability:** Design the system for scalability from the ground up.

8. **Horizontal Scaling:** Prefer horizontal scaling over vertical scaling for better scalability.

9. **Load Balancing:** Use load balancers to ensure high availability and distribute traffic.

10. **Database Selection:** Consider SQL databases for structured data and ACID transactions.

11. **NoSQL for Unstructured Data:** Opt for NoSQL databases for unstructured data.

12. **Database Sharding:** Scale SQL databases horizontally using database sharding.

13. **Indexing and Search Engines:** Utilize database indexing and search engines for efficient data retrieval.

14. **Rate Limiting:** Prevent system overload and DOS attacks with rate limiting.

15. **Real-time Communication:** Use WebSockets for real-time communication.

16. **Heartbeat Mechanisms:** Employ heartbeat mechanisms for failure detection.

17. **Message Queues:** Consider using message queues for asynchronous communication.

18. **Data Partitioning:** Implement data partitioning and sharding for large datasets.

19. **Denormalization:** Consider denormalizing databases for read-heavy workloads.

20. **Event-Driven Architecture:** Use event-driven architecture for decoupled systems.

21. **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs):** Reduce latency with CDNs for a global user base.

22. **Write-Through Cache:** Use write-through cache for write-heavy applications.

23. **Read-Through Cache:** Employ read-through cache for read-heavy applications.

24. **Blob/Object Storage:** Use blob/object storage for media files.

25. **Data Replication and Redundancy:** Implement data replication to avoid single points of failure.

26. **Autoscaling:** Scale resources dynamically with autoscaling.

27. **Asynchronous Processing:** Run background tasks asynchronously.

28. **Idempotent Operations:** Simplify error handling with idempotent operations.

29. **Microservices:** Consider microservices for flexibility and scalability.

30. **Data Lakes/Warehouses:** Utilize data lakes or warehouses for analytics and reporting.
